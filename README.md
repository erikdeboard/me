# me
Erik DeBoard

I like building teams that enjoy learning and improving.
I love finding what they're good at... what they really enjoy... what makes them tick... and helping them do that. Everyone wins.
I get absolute joy at seeing something the teams built being used... and then learning more.

I ask "what if" a lot.  I ask "why" a lot.

I hire for inquisitiveness. I work for passionate people and businesses.

I want to solve big, tough, long term technology and people problems.
